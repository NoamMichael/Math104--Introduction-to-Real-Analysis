    \item If $f$ is a continuous mapping of a metric space $X$ into a metric space $Y$, prove that
    \[
    f(\overline{E}) \subset \overline{f(E)}
    \]
    for every set $E \subset X$. ($\overline{E}$ denotes the closure of $E$.) Show, by an example, that the converse is not necessarily true.

    \item Let $f$ be a continuous real function on a metric space $X$. Let $Z(f)$ (the \textit{zero set} of $f$) be the set of all $p \in X$ at which $f(p) = 0$. Prove that $Z(f)$ is closed.

    \setcounter{enumi}{6}
    \item If $E \subset X$ and if $f$ is a function defined on $X$, the \textit{restriction} of $f$ to $E$ is the function $g$ whose domain of definition is $E$, such that $g(p) = f(p)$ for $p \in E$. 
    
    Define $f$ and $g$ on $\mathbb{R}^2$ by: $f(0, 0) = g(0, 0) = 0$, and
    \[
    f(x, y) = \frac{xy^2}{x^2 + y^4}, \quad g(x, y) = \frac{xy^2}{x^2 + y^6} \quad \text{if } (x, y) \neq (0, 0).
    \]
    Prove that $f$ is bounded on $\mathbb{R}^2$, that $g$ is unbounded in every neighborhood of $(0, 0)$, and that $f$ is not continuous at $(0, 0)$; nevertheless, the restrictions of both $f$ and $g$ to every straight line in $\mathbb{R}^2$ are continuous!
